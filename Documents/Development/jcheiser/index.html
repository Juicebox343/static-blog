      <h1>Hi! I'm Joe</h1>
      <p>I’m a web developer interested in creating full stack applications and helping folks.</p>
      <p>Over at <a href='https://heiserj.com'>heiserj.com</a> I’m focusing on helping the LGBTQIA+ community and those in sex-friendly businesses prosper online.</p>
      <p>But that doesn’t stop me from building nerdy, dorky, and/or incredibly niche websites and applications that really only serve to keep my GitLab/GitHub account warm and scratch a very specific itch.</p>

              <p>Similar to Yelp, Yelpheim allows users to create locations, upload photos, and set tags for locations built around their Valheim worlds. Also allows for other residents of that world to comment and view eachother’s creations.</p>

              <p>This poorly named app helped me quickly reference the prices of various fish and bugs during that 3 month period when everyone was playing New Horizons. </p>
              <p>Used an external API to get most of the data and images, although I did some extra compression on the images to keep them small. </p>

              <p>I’m bad at Age of Empires. So while I was playing Age of Empires 2 HD I made this to help me keep track of which civilization had which bonuses. </p>
              <p>It is not pretty. But it was fun to parse through one of the games text files and convert it to JSON.</p>
              <p>Later I realized the Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition gave you all this info upfront. Whoops.</p>

              <p>Ill conceived at best, this API set out to supply data for the various ships throughout Star Trek. Considering the relative power levels and armaments are wildly inconsistent, this was a fools errand, but I still like the idea.</p>
